# Book Wyrm Book-Tracker App

## What It Does

The Book Wyrm app is an application for finding, rating, and reviewing books, as well as for seeing the average ratings and the reviews of other users. Despite the tongue-in-cheek declaration in the header, it is in fact a much-simplified knockoff of [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). Using it is pretty self-explanatory. On the left-hand side of the screen is a search form that will search [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) for books by either title or author, depending on which dropdown option is selected. The results are displayed on pages of ten books each, with buttons to navigate between pages. Each book is rendered with the cover image (if available), the title, the author's name, and a button to select the book to see more details. Clicking on the button will render a more detailed description of the book in the center of the webpage (unless the book has no cover image, which is a bug that I'm aware of but haven't gotten around to fixing yet). This description includes Book Wyrm-specific information where applicable, such as ratings, reviews, etc. Also included are buttons to rate, review, and mark as read/want to read, but an error message will be displayed if these buttons are clicked when no user is logged in, which takes us to the next part of the site. On the right-hand side is a login form, as well as a "create account" button to switch forms if a new user is being created. Once the login information is submitted (assuming that it's correct), buttons to display the read list and wish list for that user will be displayed, with the read list being the first list displayed by default. These lists are rendered similarly to the search result lists, with the user's rating and review (if applicable) added to the read list. In addition, there is a logout button that will remove the lists and bring back up the login form. As I said, navigating the app is fairly intuitive and self-explanatory, although (more on this soon) to function properly it needs json-server active and watching the db.json file.
